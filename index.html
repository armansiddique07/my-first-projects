                Web development community is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web)
                or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static
                page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A
                more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering,
                Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
